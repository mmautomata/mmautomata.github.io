Title: Proofs and Computation
<br><br>

Abstract: Proofs have always gone hand in hand with the development of (the theory of)
        computation. The Turing Machine was conceived to generalize and extend Godel's 
        incompleteness theorem. The P vs. NP question emerged in part out of an effort to 
        understand the complexity of theorem-proving. And modern theories of optimization, 
        cryptography and even aspects of quantum physics are intimately tied to novel notions associated with proofs such interaction and randomness. In this talk we will survey some of these classical connections as well as the more modern ones; and ponder some, as of yet unresolved, enigmas associated with proofs we use in day to day (mathematical) life.

      Title: Hardness of Coin problem for Branching Programs
<br><br>
Abstract: Given a sequence of n independent coin tosses, where the coin is biased towards either heads or tails with probability 1/2 + β, the goal of the coin problem is to determine which way the coin is biased. In this talk, we will survey the recent results for the space complexity of the coin problem in the streaming setting (both for the one-pass and multi-pass streaming). This corresponds to quantifying the width of a one-pass (or read-once) branching program solving the problem. The coin problem becomes more difficult as β becomes smaller. 

Statistically, it can be solved whenever β = Ω(1/√n), using counting. We first show that for β = O(1/√n), counting is essentially optimal (equivalently, width poly(n) is necessary using an information-theoretic proof [BGW'20]. We extend this to even constant-pass programs [BGL+'24].

On the other hand, the coin problem only requires O(log n) width when β > 1/n^{0.306} (following low-width simulation of AND-OR tree of [Val'84]). Using a combinatorial proof [BGZ'21], we show that a width of poly(n) is necessary for one-pass streaming when β < 1/n^{0.33} (and this is tight).

Title: Lower Bounds for Planar Arithmetic Circuits
<br><br>
Abstract: Arithmetic circuits are a natural computational model for  computing multivariate polynomials over a field. Planar arithmetic  circuits are circuits whose underlying graph is planar. The size of a  circuit which is the number of vertices in the underlying graph is a  fundamental parameter concerning circuits. In this talk, we will prove   a super-linear lower bound on the size of planar arithmetic circuits  computing an explicit bilinear form. More generally, we will  walk-through the algebraic complexity of bilinear forms. Furthermore,  Baur and Strassen(1983) showed that all the first order partial  derivatives of a polynomial can be simultaneously computed with only a  constant factor blow-up in size. We observe that an analogous  statement does not hold in the case of planar circuits.

This talk is based on joint work with Pratik Shastri(IMSc).

Title: On the composition of approximate degree
<br><br>
Abstract: For any two Boolean functions f:{0,1}^n -> {0,1} and g:{0,1}^m->{0,1}, 
the composed function is defined as f o g (X1, X2, ... , Xn) = f(g(X1),g(X2),...,g(Xn)). 
A central question in complexity theory is to understand how complexity measures behave under composition.  
An immensely useful complexity measure associated with a Boolean function is its approximate degree. 
For a Boolean function f,  the least degree of a polynomial that pointwise approximates f within error 1/3 
is called the approximate degree of f. Let us denote it by adeg(f). 
The composition question for approximate degree posits that adeg(f o g) = \Theta(adeg(f) adeg(g)).  
In a seminal work, Sherstov (2013) showed the upper bound, i.e., adeg(f o g) = O(adeg(f) adeg(g)). 
However, there are only a few cases in which the matching lower bound has been established. 
In this talk we will see some recent attempts at addressing the lower bound question for some new classes of functions.

Title: On the Power of Homogeneous Algebraic Formulas
        <br><br>
Abstract: Proving explicit lower bounds on the size of algebraic formulas is a long-standing open problem in the area of algebraic complexity theory. Recent results in the area have indicated a way forward for attacking this question: show that we can convert a general algebraic formula to a homogeneous algebraic formula with moderate blow-up in size, and prove strong lower bounds against the latter model. Here, a homogeneous algebraic formula F for a polynomial P is a formula in which all subformulas compute homogeneous polynomials. In particular, if P is homogeneous of degree d, F does not contain subformulas that compute polynomials of degree greater than d. We investigate the feasibility of the above strategy and prove a number of positive and negative results in this direction. Joint work with Hervé Fournier (Univ Paris-Cité), Nutan Limaye (IT-University of  Copenhagen) and Sébastien Tavenas (Université Savoie Mont-Blanc).
